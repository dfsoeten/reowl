## Environment

### Prerequisites to work on the project

- A recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Main technologies

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [Nuxt.js](https://fr.nuxtjs.org)

### Branching model

I'm using the [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model.

## Local development with dev server

`npm run dev`

## Deploy to production

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is used to build, deploy & host the website.

You just have to push to the `master` branch.

## Find and fix problems in the JavaScript code

`npm run lint`

## Analyse the webpack bundle content

`npm run build:analyze`
